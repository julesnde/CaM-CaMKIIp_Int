# CaM-CaMKIIp_Int
Experiment and Simulation Reveal Residual Details for How Target Binding Tunes Calmodulinâ€™s Calcium-binding Properties

This repository contains data/codes to simulate the interactions between Ca2+/CaM and CaMKII peptide
The goal is to investigate how the Ca2+/CaM binding domain of CaMKII (CaMKII peptide) 
and its 1- and 3-amino acid mutation bind and modulate the CaM's Ca2+ properties.

There are three simulation sets: 
The wild-type RRK peptide interactions with Ca2+/CaM. 
1-amino acid mutation RAK peptide (RRK -> RAK) interactions with Ca2+/CaM. 
3-amino-acid mutation AAA peptide (RRK -> AAA) interactions with Ca2+/CaM.
